# DeepSeek RTX4 Operations

This document describes the deployed worker and router contract. Do not put
account IDs, private addresses, API keys, or S3 release names in this file.

## Topology

- `g7e.24xlarge` workers serve DeepSeek V4 Flash DSpark with four RTX PRO 6000
  Blackwell GPUs, TP=4, NVFP4 MLA KV cache, and DSpark speculative decoding.
- Worker Auto Scaling Groups are maintained in Ohio (`us-east-2`), Oregon
  (`us-west-2`), and Virginia (`us-east-1`). Workers use Spot capacity by
  default. Any temporary on-demand base capacity must be explicitly removed
  after validation.
- One on-demand sticky router discovers the configured regional ASGs through
  AWS APIs. Its `AWS_ASG_TARGETS` value uses
  `region:auto-scaling-group,region:auto-scaling-group` entries.
- Network paths from the router to every worker are private. Cloudflare AI
  Gateway selects the self-hosted route before external provider fallbacks.

## Worker startup and releases

The active launch-template user data is `worker-user-data-s3-nvme.sh`.

1. It copies an immutable regional S3 release to
   `/opt/dlami/nvme/deepseek-model`.
2. It verifies the release manifest before starting the service.
3. It sets `HF_CACHE` and `MODEL_DIR` to the staged NVMe model path.
4. It starts `deepseek-rtx4.service`.

The S3 release includes weights and reusable vLLM, TorchInductor, Triton, and
FlashInfer artifacts. Local NVMe is intentionally disposable after an eviction;
the regional S3 release is the durable source. The runtime AMI must already
include Docker, the runtime image, this repository, and the systemd service.

Use `promote-s3-nvme-launch-template.sh` for launch-template updates. It
embeds the S3/NVMe user data and removes the legacy model-cache EBS mapping.
Do not reintroduce snapshot-backed model volumes or Fast Snapshot Restore
without a separate measured migration proposal.

## Routing, cache affinity, and priority

The router only sends a worker traffic after `GET /v1/models` succeeds. An ASG
instance in `InService` is not necessarily ready while weights load.

Rendezvous hashing keeps a stable `X-Session-ID`, `X-Conversation-ID`,
`X-Sticky-Key`, or `X-User-ID` on one healthy worker. A missing backend causes
only its assigned sessions to remap.

The trusted caller may set `X-Chiridion-VLLM-Priority`. The router clamps it to
`0..1000` and converts it to vLLM's JSON `priority` only for self-hosted
requests. Lower values run first; `0` is the paid-service convention and `100`
is the free-service convention. The external fallback request body remains
OpenAI-compatible.

## Runtime baseline

The service default is `MAX_NUM_SEQS=64`, `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=8192`,
`MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144`, and priority scheduling. Keep batch-size changes behind
a reproducible benchmark. A prior `12288` token prefetch canary regressed from
the 8192 baseline and was not adopted.

KV tiered offload remains an opt-in experimental setting in the launch script;
it is not enabled for serving workers because the current vLLM runtime did not
reliably complete engine initialization with large CPU/filesystem tiers.

## Recovery and verification

1. The ASG requests a replacement using its configured Spot allocation policy.
2. User data stages and verifies the S3 artifact, then starts vLLM.
3. The router discovery loop probes `/v1/models` and adds the worker only when
   it is healthy.
4. Confirm `GET /healthz` and `GET /router/backends` on the router before
   moving traffic or declaring capacity recovered.

For a controlled validation, use a temporary on-demand instance only long
enough to verify staging, model loading, and a request through the router. Then
restore the ASG's Spot-only on-demand base capacity and desired count.
